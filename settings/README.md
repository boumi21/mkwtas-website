# settings

Folder that contains configuration files with private data.

## config.ini.template

1. Duplicate *config.ini.template*
2. Rename the duplicated file in *config.ini*
3. Edit the *config.ini* file with your private info

* *config.ini* file contains private info and should not be on Github. This should be handled in the *.gitignore* file. But always verify before comiting 	:wink:
* Modify *config.ini.template* only when you add a new variable in it!
